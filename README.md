# pppmodel

pppmodel is a reimplementation of a model orginally proposed by McIntyre et al. (1989) describing a F-type non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in erythrocytes. Later this model was adapted by Berthon et al. (1993) for the in silico replication of NMR studies.
Using modelbase, the time course of diverse Glucose-6-phosphate isotopomers were replicated
